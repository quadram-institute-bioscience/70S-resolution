# resolution of the ribosomal RNA operon 
Scripts for replication of the rRNA operon manuscript. 
The reference genomes were downloaded from NCBI with the software [ncbi-genome-download](https://github.com/kblin/ncbi-genome-download) 
and are not included here due to space. They should be moved to directory `bigdata`. 

We also excluded from this repository the  
[taxonomic classification from GTDB](https://data.ace.uq.edu.au/public/gtdb/data/releases/release89/89.0/bac120_metadata_r89.tsv) (200MB), 
which should also be downloaded and moved to diredctory `bigdata`.

The intermediate files generated by the notebooks will be found in subdirectories (ignored by git at present).
Files larger than 1MB will be compressed with gzip.
