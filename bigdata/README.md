##  RefSeq genomes
The reference genomes were downloaded from NCBI with the software [ncbi-genome-download](https://github.com/kblin/ncbi-genome-download) 
and are not included here due to space.
Here is where the downloaded genomes should go, where the `names.txt` files are the output of the ncbi-genome-download runs. 
Notice that the scripts asssume one directory per genus.

## GTDB classification
We also dowloaded the classification based on [GTDB](https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org), in particular the 
[metadata from release 89](https://data.ace.uq.edu.au/public/gtdb/data/releases/release89/89.0/bac120_metadata_r89.tsv).
It contains the accession numbers from RefSeq together with the inferred taxonomic classification.
