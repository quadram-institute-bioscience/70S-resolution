#  RefSeq genomes
The reference genomes were downloaded from NCBI with the software [ncbi-genome-download](https://github.com/kblin/ncbi-genome-download) 
and are not included here due to space.
Here is where the downloaded genomes should go, where the `names.txt` files are the output of the ncbi-genome-download runs. 
Notice that the scripts asssume one directory per genus.
